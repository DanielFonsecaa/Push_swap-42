# Push_swap-42

Push_swap is a 42 project that challenges you to sort numbers on a stack using a limited set of operations. This repository contains my solution to the challenge.

## Why I Chose Radix Sort Instead of Turkish Sort

I chose to implement Radix sort for this project because it is not just efficient for Push_swap, but also widely used in real-life situations where large sets of integers need to be sorted quickly. Radix sort is the foundation for many high-performance systems because:

- **Real-World Applicability:**  
  Radix sort is actually used in various industrial and software applications, such as sorting large databases, processing digital signals, and organizing data in telecommunications. Its practicality and widespread adoption make it a valuable algorithm to understand and implement.

- **Scalability:**  
  Radix sort easily handles large datasets efficiently, which is important in both the project and real-world scenarios.

- **Deterministic Performance:**  
  The algorithm offers predictable linear time complexity for integer sorting, which is crucial for applications where performance consistency matters.

### Why Not Turkish (Turk) Sort?

While Turkish sort is an interesting academic concept, it is not commonly used in real-world systems. Its lack of practical applications and optimizations makes it less relevant outside of theoretical exercises.

### Conclusion

By choosing Radix sort, I not only optimized my Push_swap solution but also focused on an algorithm that is valuable in actual software engineering and data processing tasks.
